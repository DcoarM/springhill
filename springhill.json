Help keep the community Foundation wiping is not allowed UNLESS you intend on taking the spot. Any tribe in violation of this is subject to total structure wipe.\"\n\nSTRUCTURE RULES No building in Artifact Caves Taming Pens must be left unlocked or be destroyed when finished taming. (helps keep the server running smoothly.) Building Restrictions (e.g., no resource blocking) No mass land claiming, aka putting pilers all around the map they will be removed unless near your base. No Griefing (spawn camping) Raid and leave. AKA after raid let them rebuild. No Cheating or Exploiting\n\\n\n\nAdmin Transparency Guaranteed We do not support spawning back item / tame loss on crashes we all suffer. We do not get items / tames back from meshing we all deal with it sadly.",
